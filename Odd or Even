/*
Least Significant Bit (LSB)
The Least Significant Bit (LSB) is the rightmost bit in the binary representation of a number. For example:

For 4 (which is 0100 in binary), the LSB is 0.
For 7 (which is 0111 in binary), the LSB is 1.

For Even Numbers: The binary representation ends in 0. When you use n & 1, you get 0 because 0 & 1 is 0.
For Odd Numbers: The binary representation ends in 1. When you use n & 1, you get 1 because 1 & 1 is 1.
